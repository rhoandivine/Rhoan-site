      <p>Sam is Yanna's closest friend, and she's always been by her side. Yanna has grown to dislike him because Sam has been there for Yanna through all her problems. While they have many friends, Sam stands out as being different. He has his own struggles, but despite that, he remains by Yanna's side. When Yanna got pregnant, Sam was the one who stayed with her, but they kept the identity of the father a secret from their other friends. The truth was that Sam was the father, but they didn't want others to know. Avi, Yanna's son, has a wonderful aunt who is always there for him. She's the best aunt anyone could ask for.</p>
